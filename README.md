#Number Plate Detection using OpenCV    

This project demonstrates an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system implemented in Python using OpenCV. The system aims to efficiently detect and recognize vehicle number plates from images or video streams.  



#Features   
Detects and extracts number plates from vehicle images.
Recognizes alphanumeric characters from the extracted number plates.
Provides real-time processing capabilities for video streams.
Offers configurable parameters for optimization and customization.
